# Pokemon Type Calculator
![Working app image](https://i.imgur.com/jLh5rtt.png?1)  
Simple Android application written in C# with Xamarin.Android. This app shows damage multipliers that affect defending pokemon.  
After selecting types and hitting the `SHOW DAMAGE TAKEN` button it displays every possible attacking pokemon type and
a multiplier of its damage. The list of multipliers and types is sorted by the dmg multiplier from highest to lowest by default.  
There are 3 ways of sorting available:
by the `Type` alphabetically (from A to Z), by the `Damage multiplier` value (descending) and by the default type order from the games.
